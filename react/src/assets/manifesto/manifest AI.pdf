Dear friends of artificial intelligence,

We live in a time where technology is evolving at a rapid pace, disrupting both our daily lives and our future. Artificial intelligence (AI) is at the heart of this revolution, transforming industries, creating new opportunities while solving problems that humanity has faced for decades. However, these technological advancements also raise ethical questions and important challenges.

We, the members of MANIFEST AI, are committed to ethical and beneficial AI to humanity. We are committed to promoting responsible, moral, and human-centered artificial intelligence. We write this manifesto to rally all those who believe in the power of AI to improve our lives, while preserving our humanity and ensuring a sustainable and equitable future for all.

AI in service of humanity
We place humans at the center of our concerns. We are dedicated to designing, developing, and deploying AI solutions that improve quality of life, reduce inequality, and strengthen solidarity among peoples. Our goal is to use AI to solve the world's most pressing challenges, such as hunger, poverty, climate change, and diseases.

Ethics and Responsibility
We solemnly pledge to respect and promote fundamental ethical principles in the development and application of AI. These principles include respect for privacy, transparency, fairness, non-discrimination, and consideration of the long-term consequences of our actions. We will ensure that AI is used for the common good and not used to amplify disparities or inflict harm on others.

Participation and Collaboration
We believe in the importance of cooperation and knowledge sharing to ensure a prosperous and harmonious future, as knowledge is the only thing that multiplies when shared. We are committed to working closely with other organizations, governments, researchers, and citizens to encourage cross-communication, mutual understanding, and collaboration to address the challenges posed by AI.

Education and Awareness
We are dedicated to promoting education and awareness on issues related to AI, to encourage responsible, reasoned, and informed adoption of these technologies, highlighting their potential benefits while warning of the risks associated with them. We will ensure that current and future generations understand the opportunities and risks associated with AI, and are able to contribute to its development in an ethical and beneficial way for all.

Emotion at the heart of our mission
We fully understand the primordial influence of human emotions in our professional practice. Aware that AI cannot be a simple automation, we believe that it should become our intuitive ally, capable of deciphering and expressing accurately our deepest emotional needs. We will integrate empathy, compassion, and humanity into our AI solutions to strengthen the connection between humans and technology, to create a future where we work together to meet challenges and celebrate our successes.

Inclusive Innovation
We are dedicated to promoting inclusive innovation, ensuring that the benefits of AI are accessible to all, regardless of their origin, gender, age, or economic status. We will fight against biases and discrimination in AI technologies, and work tirelessly to create fair and equitable solutions.

Transparency and Accountability
We pledge to be transparent in our intentions, methods, and results. We will be accountable for our actions, and our unwavering commitment to constant evaluation and improvement of our practices will demonstrate our desire to ensure a positive impact on humanity, a symbol of our deep respect for the well-being of all.

We call on all those who share our vision of ethical and beneficial AI to humanity to join us in this exciting and essential quest. Together, we can forge a future where technology serves humanity, protects our values, and nurtures our spirit of innovation and cooperation.

Together, let us write the story of a better world, shaped by ethical and human-centered artificial intelligence. Join us and take part in this collective adventure to shape the future we wish to leave to future generations.

With hope and determination,
MANIFEST AI for Ethical and Beneficial AI
